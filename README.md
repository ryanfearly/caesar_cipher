# My first Ruby exercise

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/caesar-cipher?ref=lnav)

* This is a Ruby command line implementation of the Caesar cipher
* Here are a few of my reflections immediately upon finishing
    * I have done exercise twice before - once in CS50 ages ago (I believe in C?), and recently in Javascript as part of the Odin project
    * As a result, this was a great chance to 1) improve my approach, and 2) get a feel for Ruby
    * I also really tried to take to heart the advice from TOP's lesson on Problem Solving in Ruby Basics
    * The total time to complete this was right at 80 minutes, which is much faster than my previous attempts. That starts when I completed the blank .rb file and ends when the program passed my wife's (very clever!) user tests.

* This was a lot of fun programming in Ruby. Please share any feedback you have!
